# we:Digital Evolution API fork

## Source and deployment contract

`main` packages the production source for `bbc-evo`; `staging` packages the
staging source for `bbc-stage-evo`. The source workflow publishes an immutable
`<branch>-<40-character-sha>@sha256:<digest>` reference and sends the exact
repository, branch, source SHA, image namespace, and digest to the reviewed
receiver in `we-digital/bbc-devops`.

Runtime configuration, secrets, destination inventory, migration/bootstrap,
isolation, smoke checks, and rollback remain owned by bbc-devops. Mutable image
tags are never deployment inputs.

## Minimal GitHub Actions policy

- **Behavior:** exactly one source workflow may exist and it may only package,
  publish, reuse, and dispatch an immutable Evolution API image for `main` or
  `staging`.
- **Source areas:** `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml`,
  `.github/we-digital-actions-allowlist.txt`,
  `.github/check-we-digital-actions-policy.sh`, and
  `docs/we-digital-ci-policy.md`.
- **Flags/schema:** no application flag or database schema change.
- **Upstream reapply/conflicts:** remove every workflow introduced by an
  upstream merge, keep the one-file allowlist closed by default, and refresh
  the reviewed workflow blob only after inspecting the exact diff.
- **Rollback:** revert the policy commit only together with a conscious review
  of any workflow being restored. Deployment safety checks remain mandatory.
- **Focused regression:** run the local policy checker, `git diff --check`,
  `npm run lint:check`, affected tests, a production image build for Dockerfile
  changes, and stage smoke before promotion.

## Upstream maintenance

Keep upstream Git history and reapply the fork as ordinary reviewable commits.
After every reviewed upstream merge, compare `.github/workflows`, run the local
policy checker, and preserve only the explicitly reviewed packaging workflow.
Do not revive upstream Docker Hub publishers, CodeQL, dependency review, or PR
quality jobs as part of conflict resolution.
